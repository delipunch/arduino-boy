# Bill's Arduino
*Pokemon storage system*

[Demonstration](http://youtu.be/XlqMkfmCZfM)

For if you don't have friends that still play first generation Pokemon games.

It stores one Pokemon in EEPROM, allowing you to trade with a Game Boy.

Code should be compatible with most Arduino's.

I liberally borrowed code form [gameboy-spoof](https://bitbucket.org/adanscotney/gameboy-spoof).

EDIT FOR DELIPUNCH'S FORK:  This is now for ATTINY85, and Gen II. I made a nice little cable, which mirrors data. (Spoofs you. srsly! It's identical to your save! (hence "mirror"))
